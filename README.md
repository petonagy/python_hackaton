# What is Happening Today?

Hackathon attempt to analyse some of the online Slovak news sites to get
hottest current articles and keywords.

## Why?

Because we are programmers, we are lazy and we want our programs to work for us.

## How?

By using simple analysis of suitable RSS feeds. We parse titles, perexes and keywords,
remove uninteresting stuff (stopwords) and make a bit of mumbo-jumbo with counting
occurrences and source cross-posting.

What's worth to mention:

* It took super-long to run the script, so parser runs in threads
* Very nice object abstraction considering limited time setting
* Slack integration

_disclaimer: none of us had any substantial Python or Data Science experience
at the point of writing this code_

## Example

One gif is worth more than any words...
